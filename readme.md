# This is basic implementation of guzzleHTTP for consuming APIs

Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client library. 

## Installation

Clone the repository.

Using the package manager [composer](https://getcomposer.org), cd into your project folder and run this command in your perferred terminal.

```bash
composer install
```
This will install PHP Unit and autoload the classes contained in the classes folder.

## Info

I'll be using the [Remote OK](https://remoteok.io/api?ref=producthunt) API in this example.

Ensure you have an API development environment like ``` Postman ``` or ``` Insomnia ``` installed on your system.

We'll performing a GET request on the Remote OK URL. You can see this in the ``` api_source.php ```  file which is required in the ``` index.php ```  file.

I hope newbies find this helpful. Have a good day.
